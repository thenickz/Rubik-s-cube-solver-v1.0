# Rubik-s-cube-solver-v1.0
This is a rubik's cube solver using the layers method, each layer is built one after the other

For now I only know how to solve a rubik's cube by this method, so i decided to make it automatically by myself, without any other search about the logic.
Use it the way you want. But if are earning some money with this... call me to earn money with you too!
